# dotbim-blender (Version 1.3)

## Description

It is an add-on for Blender to import and export .bim files. Check out dotbim.net or main repo for dotbim (https://github.com/paireks/dotbim) to read more about .bim files :)

Blender version >= 3.6 is required.

## How to run a script

1. First you need to install dotbimpy (https://github.com/paireks/dotbimpy) for Blender's Python. Check where it's packages (folder "site-packages) is located (e.g. for me it was C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.6\3.6\python\lib\site-packages). Once you've found it, you need to install dotbimpy there. It can be done e.g. by:
```cmd
pip install --target="your\path" dotbimpy
```
**Additional note**: sometimes it requires to open cmd with admin rights (if there is no permission to access to that directory).

2. Download this repo from Github by clicking Code button on top -> Download ZIP
3. Install add-on normally as described here: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html
